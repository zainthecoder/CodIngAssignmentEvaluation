Write a function `extract_words_tokens(any_string)` that takes a string as input and returns two numbers:
1. num_words: The number of words in string
2. num_tokens: The number of tokens in string (Please use the character-based tokenization.)

**Hint:** The string can be a single word or a sentence and
 can contain some special charecters, such as: ""!"", "","", "":""","def extract_words_tokens(any_string):

Feedback: The solution is mostly correct and it successfully implements the character-based tokenization using the `split()` method. However, there are two issues with the solution. 

1. The function is supposed to return two numbers, but it returns a tuple with the result of `print()`. The `print()` function should be replaced with a function that returns the result, such as `return`.

2. The function is missing a docstring that describes what it does. It should be included to provide a clear understanding of the function's purpose.

Here is the corrected solution:

```python
def extract_words_tokens(any_string):
    """"""
    Extracts the number of words and tokens from a given string.

    Args:
        any_string (str): The input string.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the number of words and tokens in the string.
    """"""
    # using split method to get a list of words present in the sentence.
    word_list = any_string.split("" "")

    #here len method returns the number of words present in the sentence.
    num_words = len(word_list)

    #here len method returns the number of characters present in the sentence.
    num_tokens = len(any_string)

    return num_words, num_tokens

print(extract_words_tokens(""my name is zain ul""))
```

This corrected solution will pass the evaluation and provide the correct output."

Feedback: The solution is incomplete and does not meet the requirements of the task. It does not return a dictionary, but instead prints the result. Additionally, the function does not handle any potential exceptions that may occur when reading the file or splitting the input string. 

Here's a revised version of the function that addresses these issues:

```python
def lemmatize(any_string, file_name):
    """"""
    Lemmatizes a given string using a predefined dictionary of words and their lemmas.

    Args:
    any_string (str): The input string to be lemmatized.
    file_name (str): The name of the file containing the dictionary of words and their lemmas.

    Returns:
    dict: A dictionary where the keys are the words from the input string and the values are their lemmas.
    """"""

    vocab = {}
    dictionary_of_lemmatized_words = {}

    try:
        with open(file_name, 'r', encoding='utf-8-sig') as file:
            for line in file:
                key, value = line.strip().split('\t')
                vocab[value.lower()] = key.lower()

        words = any_string.split(' ')
        for word in words:
            if word.lower() in vocab:
                dictionary_of_lemmatized_words[word] = vocab[word.lower()]
            else:
                dictionary_of_lemmatized_words[word] = word

        return dictionary_of_lemmatized_words

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f""File '{file_name}' not found."")
        return {}
    except Exception as e:
        print(f""An error occurred: {e}"")
        return {}
```

This revised function now correctly returns a dictionary, handles potential exceptions, and includes a docstring to explain its purpose and usage."

Score: 2 points
Feedback: The solution is generally correct and addresses the task requirements. However, there are some issues with the implementation:

1.  The function does not handle cases where the input string is empty or contains only whitespace characters.
2.  The function does not handle cases where the input string contains punctuation marks at the beginning or end.
3.  The function uses `print()` instead of returning the stemmed string, which makes it less flexible and reusable.
4.  The function uses `re.split()` with a regular expression that may not match all possible punctuation marks (e.g., ellipses, dashes, etc.).
5.  The function assumes that words with a length less than 3 are already stemmed, which may not be the case for all words (e.g., ""run"" is already a stem).
6.  The function does not handle cases where the input string contains words with irregular plurals or irregular verb forms (e.g., ""child"" -> ""children"", ""go"" -> ""went"").

To improve the solution, consider the following suggestions:

*   Handle edge cases, such as empty strings or strings containing only whitespace characters.
*   Use a more comprehensive regular expression for splitting the input string into words.
*   Return the stemmed string instead of using `print()`.
*   Consider using a more advanced stemming algorithm, such as Porter Stemmer or Snowball Stemmer, which can handle more complex cases."
